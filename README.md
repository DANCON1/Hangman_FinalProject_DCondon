# Hangman_FinalProject_DCondon

Hi Eric!

Here's my final project. You probably already noticed I haven't actually put it ON GitHub until the other day, my bad!
The word selection IS randomized, although this is done through using the shuffle method with a full randomized order set every cycle of the word list, hope that's okay.
Couldn't get the sounds working, unfortunately.
